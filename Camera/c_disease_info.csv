0, Scab,"
Scab disease, also known as scab or common scab, is a plant disease caused by various species of bacteria in the genus Streptomyces, particularly Streptomyces scabies. 
It affects a wide range of crops, including potatoes, beets, carrots, radishes, and other root vegetables. Symptoms of scab disease include raised, corky lesions or scabs on the surface of tubers or roots. These lesions are typically brown, rough, and can vary in size. While scab disease primarily affects the appearance of the crop, severe infections can lead to reduced yield and quality.
Scab bacteria can survive in the soil for several years, making it difficult to control once established. However, certain cultural practices can help manage the disease, such as crop rotation, planting disease-resistant varieties, and maintaining proper soil pH and moisture levels.
","Choose resistant varieties when possible.
Rake under trees and destroy infected leaves to reduce the number of fungal spores available to start the disease cycle over again next spring.
Water in the evening or early morning hours (avoid overhead irrigation) to give the leaves time to dry out before infection can occur.
Spread a 3- to 6-inch layer of compost under trees, keeping it away from the trunk, to cover soil and prevent splash dispersal of the fungal spores.
For best control, spray liquid copper soap early, two weeks before symptoms normally appear. Alternatively, begin applications when disease first appears, and repeat at 7 to 10 day intervals up to blossom drop.",https://extension.umn.edu/sites/extension.umn.edu/files/apple-scab-1.jpg
1,Black Rot,"Black rot is a destructive bacterial disease that primarily affects cruciferous vegetables, including cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, and related crops. It is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris.

The disease manifests as dark, V-shaped lesions on the leaves, starting from the leaf margin and extending inward towards the center of the leaf. As the infection progresses, the lesions may enlarge and coalesce, leading to the wilting and death of the affected leaves. The veins within the lesions often remain intact and appear as black streaks, giving the disease its characteristic name.

In addition to foliage symptoms, black rot can also affect the heads or curds of cabbage and cauliflower, causing them to rot from the inside out. Infected plants may exhibit stunted growth, reduced yield, and poor quality of produce.","Remove the cankers by pruning at least 15 inches below the end and burn or bury them. Also take preventative care with new season prunings and burn them, too.You are better off pruning during the dormant season. This will minimize the odds that fire blight will infect your tree and produce dead tissue that can easily be infected by Botryosphaeria.You should also take precautions if the bark is damaged by hail, or branches break during a windstorm. Using a copper-based fungicide will protect against both black rot and fire blight.",http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/blackrotf1.jpg
2, Cedar rust,"The most common types of cedar rust include cedar-apple rust, cedar-hawthorn rust, and cedar-quince rust, each of which involves a specific combination of host plants. These fungi have complex life cycles that involve multiple stages and host plants.

The disease typically begins its life cycle on cedar or juniper trees, where specialized structures called telia produce spores during wet weather conditions. These spores are then spread by wind to nearby susceptible hosts, such as apple trees or other members of the rose family","Choose resistant cultivars when available.
Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.
Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.
Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary.
On juniper, rust can be controlled by spraying plants with a copper solution (0.5 to 2.0 oz/ gallon of water) at least four times between late August and late October.

6, Powdery Mildew,"
Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants, including ornamentals, vegetables, fruits, and trees. It is caused by various species of fungi belonging to the genera Podosphaera and Erysiphe.

The characteristic symptom of powdery mildew is the development of a white to grayish powdery growth on the surfaces of leaves, stems, flowers, and sometimes fruits. This powdery substance consists of fungal spores and mycelium, which can spread rapidly under favorable environmental conditions.

In addition to the powdery growth, affected plant parts may exhibit other symptoms such as leaf distortion, curling, yellowing, and premature leaf drop. Severe infections can weaken plants, reduce photosynthesis, and lead to decreased yield and quality of fruits or flowers.","Disinfect the cutting edges, then prune out and discard the diseased portions of the plant immediately. At the same time, apply fungicides to protect the remaining leaves on the fruit tree. You'll need to repeat the fungicide applications according to label instructions to protect the trees over the entire season.",http://treefruit.wsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Fig1.png

8, Cercospora Leaf Spot | Gray Leaf Spot,"Cercospora Leaf Spot:
Cercospora leaf spot is caused by fungi in the genus Cercospora, with various species targeting different host plants. The disease typically manifests as small, circular to irregularly shaped spots on the leaves, initially appearing as water-soaked lesions that later turn tan to brown with gray centers. As the spots enlarge, they may merge, leading to extensive leaf damage. Severe infections can result in premature defoliation, reduced yield, and overall plant stress.
Gray Leaf Spot:
Gray leaf spot is caused by the fungus Cercospora zeae-maydis, primarily affecting corn (maize) plants. Initial symptoms include small, rectangular lesions with gray centers and dark margins on the leaves. As the disease progresses, the lesions may elongate and coalesce, forming large, irregularly shaped spots. Severely affected leaves may exhibit extensive blighting, leading to reduced photosynthesis, yield loss, and increased susceptibility to other pathogens.","Irrigate deeply, but infrequently.
Avoid using post-emergent weed killers on the lawn while the disease is active.
Avoid medium to high nitrogen fertilizer levels.
Improve air circulation and light level on lawn.

9, Common Rust,"Common rust typically appears as small, circular to elongated pustules or lesions on the leaves, stems, and sometimes other above-ground plant parts. These pustules initially appear pale green to yellow but gradually turn into raised, dusty-orange to brown structures containing masses of fungal spores as the disease progresses. Severe infections can cause extensive leaf damage, leading to reduced photosynthesis, stunted growth, and decreased yield.","To reduce the incidence of corn rust, plant only corn that has resistance to the fungus. Resistance is either in the form of race-specific resistance or partial rust resistance. In either case, no sweet corn is completely resistant. If the corn begins to show symptoms of infection, immediately spray with a fungicide.",https://ohioline.osu.edu/sites/ohioline/files/imce/Plant_Pathology/PLNTPTH-CER-02_Figure_1.png
10, Northern Leaf Blight,"The characteristic symptoms of northern leaf blight typically appear on the leaves of affected corn plants. These symptoms include the development of elongated, cigar-shaped lesions that start as small, water-soaked spots and gradually expand into larger, tan to grayish-brown lesions. The lesions often have wavy margins and may extend along the length of the leaf, causing significant damage. Severe infections can lead to extensive leaf blighting, premature leaf senescence, and reduced photosynthetic capacity, ultimately resulting in decreased yield.

Northern leaf blight thrives under conditions of high humidity, moderate temperatures (between 22-28°C or 72-82°F), and prolonged leaf wetness periods. The fungal spores can overwinter in crop debris or on alternate hosts and spread via wind, rain, or contaminated equipment.","Fungicide applications reduced Northern Corn Leaf Blight damage and protected yield. Fungicide value was higher in reducing yield in susceptible corn hybrids. Fungicide were most effective if they were applied at disease onset. Disease onset varied in growth stages, and so the best stage to apply fungicides.",https://crop-protection-network.s3.amazonaws.com/articles/NLB-Daren-Mueller-02.jpg
11, Healthy,"Vibrant Color: The foliage of a healthy plant is usually vibrant and consistent in color. Leaves should be green (or appropriate color for the species) without any signs of yellowing, browning, or discoloration.

12, Black Rot,"The disease typically starts with small, water-soaked lesions on the leaves, which gradually enlarge and turn brown to black as the infection progresses. The lesions often have a V-shaped appearance, with the point of the V extending towards the center of the leaf. As the disease advances, the lesions may merge, causing extensive leaf damage. Infected leaves may become necrotic and develop a papery texture.

Aside from foliar symptoms, black rot can also affect other plant parts, including stems and heads. On stems, the disease manifests as dark, sunken lesions, which can girdle the stem and lead to wilting and death of the plant. In cabbage and related crops, black rot can cause internal rotting of the head, rendering it unmarketable.",Mancozeb is available as BONIDE MANCOZEB FLOWABLE fungicide. It contains 37% Mancozeb and should be very effective for controlling black rot. Nova (myclobutanil) is available in IMMUNOX FUNGICIDE.

13, Esca | Black Measles,"Esca:
Esca is a complex disease syndrome that affects grapevines, particularly older vines. It is caused by a combination of fungi, including species of Phaeomoniella, Phaeoacremonium, and Fomitiporia. Esca is characterized by a range of symptoms, including:
Leaf Symptoms: Yellowing or browning of leaves, often accompanied by vein discoloration and irregular necrotic spots.
Stem Symptoms: Dark streaking or discoloration of the wood, which may extend into the trunk and arms of the vine.
Trunk Symptoms: Formation of wedge-shaped necrotic lesions on the trunk, often accompanied by white or brown fungal growth around the margins.
Foliar Symptoms: Development of distinctive tiger stripe patterns on leaves characterized by interveinal chlorosis and necrosis.
Black Measles:
Black measles, also known as black rot of grapes, is caused by the fungus Guignardia bidwellii. It primarily affects grapevines and is characterized by the development of small, black, raised lesions on grape berries. These lesions resemble measles spots, hence the name black measles. As the disease progresses, the lesions may enlarge and coalesce, leading to significant fruit rot and loss.In addition to fruit symptoms, black measles can also cause leaf spots and defoliation in severe cases. The fungus overwinters in infected plant debris and can spread via wind, rain, and contaminated pruning tools.Management of black measles involves cultural practices, such as sanitation and canopy management, to reduce disease pressure. Fungicide treatments may also be used to protect grape clusters from infection during the growing season.","Till date there is no effective method to control this disease. Remove the infected berries, leaves and trunk and destroy them. Protect the prune wounds to minimize fungal infection using wound sealant (5% boric acid in acrylic paint) or essential oil or suitable fungicides.",https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Laura-Mugnai/publication/43161073/figure/fig1/AS:340404659605512@1458170203496/Symptoms-associated-with-esca-of-grapevine-chlorosis-and-necrosis-on-the-leaves-showing_Q320.jpg
14, Leaf Blight | Isariopsis Leaf Spot,"The fungus is an obligate pathogen which can attack all green parts of the vine.
Symptoms of this disease are frequently confused with those of powdery mildew. Infected leaves develop pale yellow-green lesions which gradually turn brown. Severely infected leaves often drop prematurely.Infected petioles, tendrils, and shoots often curl, develop a shepherd's crook, and eventually turn brown and die.
Young berries are highly susceptible to infection and are often covered with white fruiting structures of the fungus. Infected older berries of white cultivars may turn dull gray-green, whereas those of black cultivars turn pinkish red.","Apply dormant sprays to reduce inoculum levels.

16, Haunglongbing | Citrus Greening,"Citrus greening disease is a disease of citrus caused by a vector-transmitted pathogen. HLB is distinguished by the common symptoms of yellowing of the veins and adjacent tissues; followed by splotchy mottling of the entire leaf, premature defoliation, dieback of twigs, decay of feeder rootlets and lateral roots, and decline in vigor, ultimately followed by the death of the entire plant. Affected trees have stunted growth, bear multiple off-season flowers (most of which fall off), and produce small, irregularly shaped fruit with a thick, pale peel that remains green at the bottom and tastes very bitter. Common symptoms can often be mistaken for nutrient deficiencies; however, the distinguishing factor between nutrient deficiencies is the pattern of symmetry. Nutrient deficiencies tend to be symmetrical along the leaf vein margin, while HLB has an asymmetrical yellowing around the vein. The most noticeable symptom of HLB is greening and stunting of the fruit, especially after ripening","The only way to prevent the spread of Citrus Greening Disease is to control ACP(Asian Citrus Psyllid). Since citrus is such a popular and widely-planted garden tree, homeowners are on the front lines of this important battle.Spray the lemon tree with Neem oil insecticide, both the top and undersides of the foliage.

These potent little packages protect your heart, increase HDL (good) cholesterol, lower your blood pressure, and guard against cancer.

Packed with vitamins, fiber, and particularly high levels of antioxidants known as polyphenols, strawberries are a sodium-free, fat-free, cholesterol-free, low-calorie food. They are among the top 20 fruits in antioxidant capacity and are a good source of manganese and potassium. Just one serving -- about eight strawberries -- provides more vitamin C than an orange.",https://www.canr.msu.edu/uploads/images/7-12-11-MARK-plhstrw4.jpg
29, Bacterial Spot,"Initial symptoms are small, water-soaked spots on the undersides of leaves, which eventually turn dark brown or black.
The spots can be surrounded by a yellow halo and may merge to form larger necrotic areas.
The bacteria can be spread through infected seeds, transplants, and plant debris.
Bacterial spot is primarily disseminated by splashing water (rain or irrigation), wind-driven rain, and human activity (e.g., handling plants).","Plant pathogen-free seed or transplants to prevent the introduction of bacterial spot pathogens on contaminated seed or seedlings.  If a clean seed source is not available or you suspect that your seed is contaminated, soak seeds in water at 122�F for 25 min. to kill the pathogens.  To keep leaves dry and to prevent the spread of the pathogens, avoid overhead watering (e.g., with a wand or sprinkler) of established plants and instead use a drip-tape or soaker-hose.  Also to prevent spread, DO NOT handle plants when they are wet (e.g., from dew) and routinely sterilize tools with either 10% bleach solution or (better) 70% alcohol (e.g., rubbing alcohol).  Where bacterial spot has been a recurring problem, consider using preventative applications of copper-based products registered for use on tomato, especially during warm, wet periods.  Keep in mind however, that if used excessively or for prolonged periods, copper may no longer control the disease.  Be sure to read and follow all label instructions of the product that you select to ensure that you use it in the safest and most effective manner possible.",https://www.growingproduce.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bacterial_spot_tomato.jpg
30, Early Blight,"Early symptoms appear as small, irregular brown spots on older leaves. These spots often have concentric rings, creating a target or bullseye pattern.
The spots gradually enlarge, and as they merge, they cause significant leaf blight.
Infected leaves may turn yellow and eventually die, typically from the bottom of the plant upwards.
Alternaria solani produces spores (conidia) that are spread by wind rain and irrigation water.
The fungus overwinters in infected plant debris soil and seed producing new spores each growing season.","Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.
Make sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.
Keep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.
Drip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.
For best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.
Containing copper and pyrethrins, Bonide� Garden Dust is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, cover both the tops and undersides of leaves with a thin uniform film or dust. Depending on foliage density, 10 oz will cover 625 sq ft. Repeat applications every 7-10 days, as needed.",https://extension.umn.edu/sites/extension.umn.edu/files/styles/large/public/early-blight-leaf-tomato.jpg?itok=woYQQlrF
31, Late Blight,"Late blight can cause catastrophic losses in both home gardens and commercial agriculture. The rapid spread and severity of the disease can lead to complete crop failure if not managed properly.
Phytophthora infestans produces two types of spores: sporangia and zoospores. Sporangia are spread by wind, rain, and irrigation water. Zoospores are motile and require water for dispersal.
The pathogen survives between seasons in infected tubers, plant debris, and soil.
","Sanitation is the first step in controlling tomato late blight. Clean up all debris and fallen fruit from the garden area. This is particularly essential in warmer areas where extended freezing is unlikely and the late blight tomato disease may overwinter in the fallen fruit. Currently, there are no strains of tomato available that are resistant to late tomato blight, so plants should be inspected at least twice a week. Since late blight symptoms are more likely to occur during wet conditions, more care should be taken during those times. For the home gardener, fungicides that contain maneb, mancozeb, chlorothanolil or fixed copper can help protect plants from late tomato blight. Repeated applications are necessary throughout the growing season as the disease can strike at any time. For organic gardeners, there are some fixed copper products approved for use; otherwise, all infected plants must be immediately removed and destroyed.","https://www.canr.msu.edu/contentAsset/image/e97d1ef0-5b55-49b0-ab4e-c57dcbeca65e/fileAsset/filter/Resize,Jpeg/resize_w/750/jpeg_q/80"
32, Leaf Mold,"Leaf mold can significantly reduce the photosynthetic capacity of tomato plants, leading to reduced fruit size, yield, and quality. In severe cases, it can cause almost complete defoliation, severely impacting plant health and productivity.
The fungus produces conidia (spores) on the undersides of infected leaves. These spores are spread by air currents, water splash, and contact with infected plants.
The spores can survive on plant debris, greenhouse structures, and in the soil, providing a source of inoculum for new infections.","When treating tomato plants with fungicide, be sure to cover all areas of the plant that are above the soil, especially the underside of leaves, where the disease often forms. Calcium chloride-based sprays are recommended for treating leaf mold issues. Organic fungicide options are also available.",https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tomato-leaf-mold-400x300.jpg
33, Septoria Leaf Spot,"Septoria leaf spot can cause significant defoliation, reducing the photosynthetic capacity of the plant and leading to lower yields and fruit quality. The premature loss of leaves also exposes fruits to sunscald, further reducing marketability.
The fungus produces spores (conidia) in the fruiting bodies (pycnidia) on infected plant debris and lesions.
Spores are spread by rain splash, irrigation water, wind, and human activity.","Remove diseased leaves. 
Improve air circulation around the plants.
Mulch around the base of the plants. Mulching will reduce splashing soil, which may contain fungal spores associated with debris. Apply mulch after the soil has warmed.
Do not use overhead watering. Overhead watering facilitates infection and spreads the disease. Use a soaker hose at the base of the plant to keep the foliage dry. Water early in the day.
Control weeds. Nightshade and horsenettle are frequently hosts of Septoria leaf spot and should be eradicated around the garden site.
Use crop rotation. Next year do not plant tomatoes back in the same location where diseased tomatoes grew. Wait 1�2 years before replanting tomatoes in these areas.
Use fungicidal sprays.",https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/portals/0/Gardening/Gardening%20Help/images/Pests/Septoria_Leaf_Spot_of_Tomato187.jpg
34, Spider Mites | Two-Spotted Spider Mite,"Two-spotted spider mites can cause severe damage to a wide range of plants, reducing their vigor, yield, and aesthetic value. In commercial agriculture and horticulture, infestations can lead to significant economic losses.
Two-spotted spider mites reproduce rapidly, especially in hot, dry conditions. Females can lay several hundred eggs during their lifetime.
The entire life cycle from egg to adult can be as short as one week under optimal conditions (high temperatures and low humidity).","Avoid weedy fields and do not plant eggplant adjacent to legume forage crops.
Avoid early season, broad-spectrum insecticide applications for other pests.
Do not over-fertilize.
Overhead irrigation or prolonged periods of rain can help reduce populations.",https://entomology.ca.uky.edu/files/styles/panopoly_image_original/public/310a.jpg?itok=XNlP0H9H
35, Target Spot,"Target spot, also known as target leaf spot or target blight, is a fungal disease that affects a variety of plants, including vegetables, ornamentals, and field crops. It is caused by several species of fungi, with different pathogens affecting different host plants. Target spot gets its name from the characteristic concentric rings that form within the lesions on infected plant tissue, resembling a target. 
The fungi that cause target spot produce spores (conidia) on infected plant tissue, such as leaves and stems.
Spores are spread by wind, rain, irrigation water, and human activity.","Cultural control is important. The following should be done:
Do not plant new crops next to older ones that have the disease.
Plant as far as possible from papaya, especially if leaves have small angular spots (Photo 5).
Check all seedlings in the nursery, and throw away any with leaf spots.
Remove a few branches from the lower part of the plants to allow better airflow at the base
Remove and burn the lower leaves as soon as the disease is seen, especially after the lower fruit trusses have been picked.
Keep plots free from weeds, as some may be hosts of the fungus.
Do not use overhead irrigation; otherwise, it will create conditions for spore production and infection.
Collect and burn as much of the crop as possible when the harvest is complete.
Practise crop rotation, leaving 3 years before replanting tomato on the same land.",https://barmac.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/01/Target-Spot-Tomato1.jpg
36, Yellow Leaf Curl Virus,"
Yellow leaf curl virus, often referred to as Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV), is a highly destructive viral disease that affects tomatoes and other plants in the Solanaceae family, such as peppers and eggplants. It is transmitted by the sweet potato whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) and can cause significant yield losses in affected crops. 
TYLCV is primarily transmitted by the sweet potato whitefly (Bemisia tabaci), which feeds on infected plants and then spreads the virus to healthy plants as it feeds.
The virus can also be transmitted through infected plant material, including seeds and transplants.",Use only virus-and whitefly-free tomato and pepper transplants. Transplants should be treated with Capture (bifenthrin) or Venom (dinotefuran) for whitefly adults and Oberon for eggs and nymphs. Imidacloprid or thiamethoxam should be used in transplant houses at least seven days before shipping. Imidacloprid should be sprayed on the entire plant and below the leaves; eggs and flies are often found below the leaves. Spray every 14-21 days and rotate on a monthly basis with Abamectin so that the whiteflies do not build-up resistance to chemicals.,https://gd.eppo.int/media/data/taxon/T/TYLCV0/pics/1024x0/10609.jpg
37, Mosaic Virus,"Mosaic virus is a group of plant viruses that cause a characteristic mottling or discoloration of leaves, often resembling a mosaic pattern. There are several different types of mosaic viruses that affect a wide range of plants, including vegetables, ornamentals, and agricultural crops.
Mosaic viruses are typically transmitted by several means, including insect vectors, contaminated tools or equipment, infected seeds or transplants, and mechanical transmission through physical contact.
Insects such as aphids, thrips, whiteflies, and leafhoppers are common vectors for mosaic viruses, transmitting the virus as they feed on infected plants and move between plants.","Use certified disease-free seed or treat your own seed.
Soak seeds in a 10% solution of trisodium phosphate (Na3PO4) for at least 15 minutes.
Or heat dry seeds to 158 �F and hold them at that temperature for two to four days.
Purchase transplants only from reputable sources. Ask about the sanitation procedures they use to prevent disease.
Inspect transplants prior to purchase. Choose only transplants showing no clear symptoms.
Avoid planting in fields where tomato root debris is present, as the virus can survive long-term in roots.
Wash hands with soap and water before and during the handling of plants to reduce potential spread between plants.",http://ucanr.edu/blogs/dirt/blogfiles/71403_original.jpg
38, Healthy,"Vibrant Color: The foliage of a healthy plant is usually vibrant and consistent in color. Leaves should be green (or appropriate color for the species) without any signs of yellowing, browning, or discoloration.
Strong Growth: Healthy plants demonstrate vigorous growth with sturdy stems and branches. They develop new leaves and shoots regularly, showing an overall robust appearance.
Firm Texture: The leaves and stems of a healthy plant feel firm to the touch, indicating turgor pressure and proper hydration. Wilting or limp foliage may be a sign of stress or inadequate water uptake.
No Signs of Disease or Pests: Healthy plants are typically free from visible signs of disease, such as lesions, spots, or abnormal growths. They also show no evidence of pest infestations, such as chewed leaves, webbing, or insect activity.","The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is a fruit from the nightshade family native to South America.

Despite botanically being a fruit, it�s generally eaten and prepared like a vegetable.

Tomatoes are the major dietary source of the antioxidant lycopene, which has been linked to many health benefits, including reduced risk of heart disease and cancer.

They are also a great source of vitamin C, potassium, folate, and vitamin K.",https://cdn8.dissolve.com/p/D869_27_632/D869_27_632_1200.jpg
